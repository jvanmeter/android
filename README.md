Android firmware and ROM flashing procedures

These scripts are a collection of Android firmware and ROM flashing procedures I have developed through experimentation (no bricked devices yet) and various web resources.  Credit for the procedures was noted when the information was captured during the initial process discovery research.

Please note that while these scripts could be executed directly, modification is required for different Android devices and OS versions.

Enjoy.
