Android firmware and ROM flashing procedures

These scripts are a collection of Android firmware and ROM flashing procedures I have developed through
experimentation (no bricked devices yet) and various web resources.  Credit for the procedures are noted when
this information was captured.

Please note that while these scripts could be executed directly, they would require modification.  The files are
best used as procedural notes and not directly executed.

Enjoy.
